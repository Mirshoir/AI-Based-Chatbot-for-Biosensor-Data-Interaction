# AI-Based-Chatbot-for-Biosensor-Data-Interaction
This project develops an AI-powered chatbot designed to process biosensor data in real-time and provide actionable health insights. Using advanced LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the chatbot analyzes data from biosensors (e.g., CSV files) and delivers personalized responses to user queries.



1. Handling .csv Data
The chatbot’s primary task is to process .csv files uploaded by users. To ensure data quality, we rely on the powerful Python libraries pandas and numpy to clean and prepare the data. By focusing on data accuracy and usability, we enhance the chatbot’s ability to provide relevant and error-free responses to user queries.

2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
In the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation, the system will break down the uploaded .csv files into manageable chunks. These chunks will then be connected to a large language model (LLM), initially using Ollama, to retrieve information. While this feature works locally for now, future updates will allow users to download processed .csv files, ensuring more flexibility when working with data. Additionally, by integrating ReAct prompting, we aim to enhance the accuracy and relevance of chatbot responses. To improve the chatbot’s performance and scalability, we plan to integrate Llama3 in the next version.

3. Embedding with Vector Databases
Once the data is processed, the chatbot will generate embeddings that represent the content in a way machine learning models can use. These embeddings, stored in Chroma DB vector database enable efficient retrieval of relevant information from past interactions. This embedding process ensures the chatbot becomes "smarter" with each interaction, learning from previous conversations to improve future responses.

4. User Interface with Streamlit
We are building the chatbot’s user interface with Streamlit, ensuring a clean, intuitive, and interactive user experience. Users will be able to upload .csv files, engage with the chatbot, and receive responses in real-time. We also plan to integrate Hugging Face models directly into the interface and add a camera feature for live video streaming. This opens the door to potential future features such as emotion tracking or accepting visual input
 for queries, making the chatbot even more interactive.

5. Delivering Results
The chatbot is designed to deliver results in a format that’s easy to understand, whether it's a text-based response or a visualization derived from the .csv data. The goal is to ensure that the information provided is not only accurate but also useful and actionable for the user.
